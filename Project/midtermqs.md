# How long (cumulative) have you spent on the code?
I have tentatively spent somewhere between 15-18 hours, but I’m not exactly sure as I’ll work on things for a few minutes here and there outside of sessions where I’m making/implementing more major/time-consuming changes.

# What was the most time-consuming part?
The most time-consuming part remains the same as the checkpoints. Implementing certain changes and having to go back through the code and troubleshoot to figure out what is causing the new code to fail.

# In retrospect, how could you have worked more efficiently?
In retrospect, the most time-consuming part of my project could in part be due to organizational issues, and/or implementing things that later need to be modified, so being better organized and thinking ahead better would definitely have made me more efficient.

# What libraries/starter code were most useful? To what extent did you need to modify them?
Import_ random was a very useful library for basic game functions, and ChatGPT’s starter code worked pretty well, and gave me a great foundation. That being said, it was also a bit difficult to follow in the way it did some things, so I had to modify it as I went, and make a decent number of improvements to progress the quality of the game.
